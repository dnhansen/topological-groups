\chapter{Definitions and basic properties}

\begin{definition}[Topological groups]
    \label{def:topological_group}
    A \emph{topological group} is a triple $(G, \mu, \calT)$ such that $(G, \mu)$ is a group, $(G, \calT)$ is a topological space, and both the multiplication $\mu \colon G \prod G \to G$ and the inversion map $\iota \colon G \to G$ given by $g \mapsto g\inv$ are continuous.
\end{definition}
%
In the sequel we will omit mentioning the multiplication and topology of a topological group and simply write $G$. It is custom to assume that a topological group be $T_1$ (or Hausdorff, which is actually implied by it being $T_1$, as we will see), but we omit this assumption since our focus is precisely on the basic topological properties of topological groups.

If $G$ is a topological group and $g \in G$, then we define maps $l_g, r_g \colon G \to G$ by $l_g(h) = gh$ and $r_g(h) = hg$; that is, $l_g$ and $r_g$ are left- and right-multiplication by $g$, respectively. Both of these are homeomorphisms, with $l_g\inv = l_{g\inv}$ and $r_g\inv = r_{g\inv}$. Hence if $a, b \in G$, then there is a homeomorphism on $G$ that takes $a$ to $b$, namely $l_{ba\inv}$. Thus a topological group is \emph{homogeneous} as a topological space.

We begin by collecting some basic properties of topological groups:

\begin{proposition}
    Let $G$ be a topological group.
    %
    \begin{enumprop}
        \item \label{enum:closure_of_product} If $A,B \subseteq G$, then $\closure{A} \closure{B} \subseteq \closure{AB}$.
        \item \label{enum:closure_of_subgroup} If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then so is $\closure{H}$.
        \item \label{enum:open_subgroup_is_closed} Every open subgroup of $G$ is closed.
        \item \label{enum:product_open_set} If $A,U \subseteq G$ with $U$ open, then $AU$ and $UA$ are open.
    \end{enumprop}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We give two proofs of \subcref{enum:closure_of_product}. Since the multiplication $\mu \colon G \prod G \to G$ is continuous we get
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        \mu(\closure{A}, \closure{B})
            = \mu(\closure{A} \prod \closure{B})
            = \mu(\closure{A \prod B})
            \subseteq \closure{\mu(A \times B)}
            = \closure{\mu(A, B)}
            = \closure{AB}.
    \end{equation*}
    %
    Alternatively, pick $a \in \closure{A}$ and $b \in \closure{B}$. If $U$ be a neighbourhood of $ab$, then by continuity of multiplication there are neighbourhoods $V_1$ and $V_2$ of $a$ and $b$ respectively such that $V_1 V_2 \subseteq U$. Picking $x \in A \intersect V_1$ and $y \in B \intersect V_2$ we find that $xy \in AB \intersect U$, so $ab \in \closure{AB}$.

    Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. By \subcref{enum:closure_of_product} we get
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        \closure{H} \closure{H} \subseteq \closure{HH} = \closure{H},
    \end{equation*}
    %
    so $\closure{H}$ is closed under multiplication. It is also closed under taking inverses, since the inverse map $\iota$ is a homeomorphism. This proves \subcref{enum:closure_of_subgroup}. Alternatively, this claim is an easy consequence of basic properties of nets.

    Now let $H$ be an open subgroup. Since $G$ is the disjoint union of the cosets of $H$, we have
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        G \setminus H
            = \bigunion_{g \in G \setminus H} gH.
    \end{equation*}
    %
    Since the cosets $gH$ are open, $G \setminus H$ is also open. This proves \subcref{enum:open_subgroup_is_closed}.

    To prove \subcref{enum:product_open_set}, notice that e.g.
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        AU = \bigunion_{g \in A} gU,
    \end{equation*}
    %
    so $AU$ is a union of open sets.
\end{proof}

We next remark that the assumption that $G$ be $T_1$ can be weakened:

\begin{proposition}
    Let $G$ be a topological group. If $G$ is $T_0$, then it is in fact $T_1$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Assume that $G$ is $T_0$. By homogeneity it suffices to show that the singleton $\{e\}$ containing the identity $e \in G$ is closed. We show that $G \setminus \{e\}$ is a neighbourhood\footnote{If $X$ is a topological space and $x \in X$, then we say that a set $A \subseteq X$ is a neighbourhood if it has an \emph{open subset $U$} containing $x$, i.e. $x \in U \subseteq A$.} of all $g \neq e$ in $G$. Since $G$ is $T_0$, either $G \setminus \{e\}$ is a neighbourhood of $g$, or $G \setminus \{g\}$ is a neighbourhood of $e$. In the first case we are done, so assume the latter. The homeomorphism $l_{g\inv}$ maps $G \setminus \{g\}$ to $G \setminus \{e\}$, so the latter set is a neighbourhood of $g\inv$. But the inversion map $\iota$ is a homeomorphism that maps $G \setminus \{e\}$ to itself, so this is also a neighbourhood of $g$.
\end{proof}

Recall that a topological space $X$ is called \emph{regular} if it is possible to separate any point from any closed set by disjoint open sets. Our next order of business is to show that any topological group is regular. Before proving this we need some terminology and a lemma:

If $G$ is a topological group and $A \subseteq G$, then we write
%
\begin{equation*}
    A\inv = \iota(A) = \set{a\inv}{a \in A}.
\end{equation*}
%
A subset $A$ is called \emph{symmetric} if $A = A\inv$. Notice that since $\iota$ is a homeomorphism, $A$ is open (closed) if and only if $A\inv$ is open (closed).

\begin{lemma}
    \label{thm:symmetric_nhood_of_e}
    Let $G$ be a topological group. If $U$ is a neighbourhood of the identity $e$, then there is a symmetric neighbourhood $V$ of $e$ such that $V V\inv \subseteq U$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Since multiplication is continuous and $ee = e$, there are neighbourhoods $V_1$ and $V_2$ of $e$ such that $V_1 V_2 \subseteq U$. Letting
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        V = V_1 \intersect V_2 \intersect V_1\inv \intersect V_2\inv,
    \end{equation*}
    %
    then $V$ has the desired properties.
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}[Regularity of topological groups]
    \label{thm:T0_implies_T3}
    Every topological group is regular. In particular, every $T_0$ topological group is $T_3$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be a topological group. By homogeneity it is enough to show that if $U$ is a neighbourhood of $e$, then $e$ has a closed neighbourhood that lies in $U$.

    Let $V$ be a symmetric neighbourhood of $e$ such that $V V\inv \subseteq U$. We claim that $\closure{V} \subseteq U$. Let $g \in \closure{V}$. Then every neighbourhood of $g$ intersects $V$, so in particular $gV \intersect V \neq \emptyset$. Choose points $v,w \in V$ such that $gv = w$. It follows that
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        g
            = w v\inv
            \in V V\inv
            \subseteq U,
    \end{equation*}
    %
    so $\closure{V} \subseteq U$.
\end{proof}


\chapter{Coset spaces and quotient groups}

\section{General properties of coset spaces}

If $H$ is a subgroup of a topological group $G$, we denote by $G/H$ the set of left cosets of $H$. Let $q \colon G \to G/H$ be the quotient map and give $G/H$ the quotient topology. We call $G/H$ a \emph{coset space} of $G$.

Notice that $q$ is in fact open: If $U \subseteq G$ is open, then $q\preim(q(U)) = UH$ is also open, so $q(U)$ is open since $G/H$ has the quotient topology coinduced by $q$.


\begin{proposition}
    Let $G$ be a topological group and $H$ a subgroup.
    %
    \begin{enumprop}
        \item \label{enum:coset_space_hausdorff} The coset space $G/H$ is Hausdorff if and only if $H$ is closed.
        
        \item \label{enum:coset_space_locally_compact} If $G$ is locally compact\footnotemark, then so is $G/H$.
    \end{enumprop}
\end{proposition}\footnotetext{We say that a topological space is locally compact if every point has a compact neighbourhood. There are many non-equivalent definitions of local compactness and this is the least restrictive one. If $H$ is closed then $G/H$ is Hausdorff, so all the usual definitions of local compactness are equivalent for $G/H$.}
%
Notice that \subcref{enum:coset_space_hausdorff} does not assume any separation properties of $G$. As far as I know, a general coset space $G/H$ with $H$ closed is not necessarily $T_3$, but of course this is the case of the coset space is in fact a topological quotient group.

\begin{proof}
    It is easy to show that $G/H$ is $T_1$ if and only if $H$ is closed.\footnote{If $G/H$ is a topological quotient group, then this is sufficient to show that $G/H$ is Hausdorff, since it is then even $T_3$ by \cref{thm:T0_implies_T3}.} Note that fibres of $q$ are cosets of $H$, and a coset $gH = l_g(H)$ is closed if and only if $H$ is. But since $G/H$ carries the quotient topology, $gH$ is closed in $G$ if and only if $\{gH\}$ is closed in $G/H$.

    Now assuming that $H$ is closed, we show that $G/H$ is Hausdorff. Let $xH$ and $yH$ be distinct (and hence disjoint) cosets. Then $xHy\inv$ is a closed set not containing $e$, so \cref{thm:symmetric_nhood_of_e} implies the existence of a symmetric neighbourhood $U$ of $e$ such that $UU \intersect xHy\inv = \emptyset$. It follows that
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        e
            \not\in U xHy\inv U
            = Ux H (Uy)\inv
            = (UxH)(UyH)\inv,
    \end{equation*}
    %
    where we use that $U = U\inv$ and $H = HH$. That $e$ does not lie in the left-most set is easily proven e.g. by contraposition. It follows that $UxH$ and $UyH$ are disjoint, and since $q$ is open this implies that $q(Ux)$ and $q(Uy)$ are disjoint neighbourhoods of $xH$ and $yH$ in $G/H$. This proves \subcref{enum:coset_space_hausdorff}.

    To prove \subcref{enum:coset_space_locally_compact}, notice that if $K$ is a compact neighbourhood of $e$ in $G$, then $q(Kx)$ is a compact neighbourhood of $xH$ in $G/H$.
\end{proof}

This proposition also furnishes a different proof that $T_1$ implies Hausdorff for topological groups: Simply let $H = \{e\}$, in which case $G \cong G/H$.


\section{Topological quotient groups}

If a subgroup $N$ of a topological group $G$ is normal, we expect that the usual group structure on the (algebraic) quotient group $G/N$ is compatible with the quotient topology. This is indeed the case:

\begin{theorem}[Topological quotient groups]
    If $N$ is a normal subgroup of a topological group $G$, then $G/N$ is a topological group.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    If $x,y \in G$ and $U$ is a neighbourhood of $(xN)(yN) = xyN$ in $G/N$, then continuity of multiplication in $G$ at $(x,y)$ implies the existence of neighbourhoods $V$ and $W$ of $x$ and $y$ respectively, such that $VW \subseteq q\preim(U)$. Since $q$ is surjective it follows that $q(V) q(W) \subseteq U$, and because $q$ is also open $q(V)$ and $q(W)$ are neighbourhoods of $xN$ and $yH$. Hence multiplication is continuous.

    Since the inversion map $\iota$ on $G/N$ is bijective, it suffices to show that it is open. Let $U \subseteq G/N$ be open and notice that, since $q$ is surjective,
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        \iota(U)
            = \iota \bigl( q(q\preim(U)) \bigr)
            = q \bigl( \iota(q\preim(U)) \bigr).
    \end{equation*}
    %
    Because $q\preim(U)$, and hence $\iota(q\preim(U))$, is open in $G$, it follows that $\iota(U)$ is open since $q$ is open.
\end{proof}

We now explore how a topological group $G$ that is \emph{not} $T_0$ can be made so by quotienting out by a particular subgroup. First we recall the $T_0$-identification of a topological space $X$: Define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$ by letting $x \sim y$ if $\closure{\{x\}} = \closure{\{y\}}$.

\begin{lemma}[$T_0$-identification]
    Let $\sim$ be the $T_0$-identification of a topological space $X$. Then the quotient space $X/{\sim}$ is $T_0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    First notice that $q(x) \subseteq \closure{\{x\}}$ for $x \in X$, since if $x \sim x'$ then $x' \in \closure{\{x'\}} = \closure{\{x\}}$. It follows that
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        \closure{\{x\}}
            = \bigunion_{x' \in \closure{\{x\}}} q(x'),
    \end{equation*}
    %
    so $\closure{\{x\}}$ is saturated and so is its complement.

    Now assume that $q(x) \neq q(y)$. Without loss of generality we may assume that $x \not\in \closure{\{y\}}$, from which it follows that $q(x) \in q(\closure{\{y\}}^c)$. We furthermore have $q(y) \not\in q(\closure{\{y\}}^c)$, since $\closure{\{y\}}^c$ is a union of equivalence classes not containing $y$, and $q(\closure{\{y\}}^c)$ is the collection of these equivalence classes. Since $\closure{\{y\}}^c$ is an open saturated set, $q(\closure{\{y\}}^c)$ is a neighbourhood of $q(x)$ not containing $q(y)$.
\end{proof}

Notice that a topological space is $T_0$ if and only if $\closure{\{x\}} \neq \closure{\{y\}}$ whenever $x \neq y$: This follows since, say, $x$ has a neighbourhood that doesn't contain $y$, so the closure of $\{y\}$ does not contain $x$. Hence if $X$ is already $T_0$, the identification leaves $X$ unchanged. [To do: show that the $T_0$-identification is the smallest equivalence relation on $X$ that makes it $T_0$.]

\begin{proposition}
    Let $G$ be a topological group. The subgroup $\closure{\{e\}}$ of $G$ is normal. Furthermore, if $\sim$ denotes the $T_0$-identification of $G$, then the $\sim$-equivalence classes are the cosets of $\closure{\{e\}}$.

    It follows that the quotient group $G / \closure{\{e\}}$ is precisely the $T_0$-identification $G/{\sim}$ of $G$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    The subgroup $\closure{\{e\}}$ is the smallest closed subgroup of $G$, hence it is normal since otherwise intersecting it with one of its conjugates yields a strictly smaller closed subgroup.

    It then suffices to show that, for $x,y \in G$, $x \sim y$ if and only if $x \closure{\{e\}} = y \closure{\{e\}}$. But this is clear since e.g. $x \closure{\{e\}} = \closure{\{x\}}$ by continuity of the multiplication on $G$.
\end{proof}

It is results like the above that lead to the general assumption that topological groups are $T_1$, since if it is not then we just quotient out by $\closure{\{e\}}$.
